# The Wedding

[Lips zoom out] <Crucify! Crucify! Crucify! Crucify!> [Cross fades in]
<These lips died for your sins!>

((Throw rice! Some theatres won't let you have rice, use confetti instead!))

[Church doors open]

Dentonian: Here they come!

[Ralph kisses a cheek] <That's not the bride, dumbass!>

Photographer: Let's get a picture. Close together now. <Who's invited to the cast orgy?> The folks and then the grandparents. Yes, all the close family.
[The group starts posing] <Quit fucking with your kid and get in the shot!>
Photographer: Smile, hold that. Beautiful. And... click!

[Richard O'Brien appears] <We see you, Riff! But the virgins don't!>

Photographer: {Congratulations!}<Ejaculations!>

Ralph: I guess we finally did it, huh.

[Ralph and Brad punch shoulders] <Asshole fight! Asshole fight! Asshole fight!>

Brad: I don't think there's any doubt about that. You and Betty have been almost inseparable since you met in Dr. Scott's refresher courses.

Ralph: Well to tell you the truth, Brad, that's the only reason I showed up in the first place. <What a fucking scholar!>

[Handicam points at screen] <Hey look, we're in the movie! Hi movie!>

Betty: Okay you guys, this is it!

Ralph: Well, looks like Betty's going to throw the bouquet.

Janet: I got it! I got it!

Ralph: Hey big fella, <How would YOU know?> looks like it could be your turn next, eh? <Sloppy seconds!>

Brad: Who knows.

Ralph: Well, so long, see you Brad. <See ya, sucker!>

[Car drives up] <It's Ralph's cum but Brad's handwriting!>

Ralph: Guess we better get going now Betty. Come on, hop in. See ya, Brad!

[Old couple running] <Hey! Old people aren't allowed to run!>

Janet: Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful? <No!> Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful? <No!> I can't believe it.
    An hour ago she was just plain old Betty Munroe, and now...
    Now she's Mrs. Ralph {Hapschatt}<Half-shit!>.

Brad: Yes Janet, Ralph's a lucky guy. <No he's not, she's got syph!>

Janet: Yes.

Dentonian: I always cry at weddings.

Brad: Uh, everyone knows that Betty is a wonderful little cook. <And a great little fuck!>

Janet: Yes.

[Billboard appears] <Get this cemetary out of my billboard!>

Brad: Why Ralph himself, he'll be in line for a promotion in a year or two.

Janet: Yes.

# Dammit, Janet

Brad: <What do horses eat!> Hey, Janet.

Janet: Yes Brad?

Brad: I've got something to say. <So say it, asshole!>

Janet: Uh huh...

Brad: I really love the <Skanky? Slimy? Slippery? Slutty?>
    Skillful way... <What a fucking genuis!>
    You beat the other girls <With whips and chains!>
    To the bride's bouquet. <And that too!>

Janet: Oh Brad...

Brad: The river was deep {but I swam it}<But so's Janet!>
    {The future is ours so let's plan it}<Her ass is the size of a planet!>
    So please, {don't tell me to can it}<tell me where I should cram it>
    I've one thing to say and that's
    Dammit, Janet, I love you <Asshole moonwalk, go!>
    The road was long but I ran it <Only assholes run backwards!>
    There's a fire in my {heart}<pants> and you fan it
    If there's one fool for you that I am it
    I've one thing to say and that's
    Dammit, Janet, I love you <Only assholes write on doors!>

[[ Run up facing Riff, yelling "fuck you Riff!" and flipping the bird; when he tosses the pitchfork, act impaled. ]]

Brad: Here's a ring to prove that I'm no joker...
    There's three ways that love can grow
    That's good, bad, or mediocre
    <How do you spell slut?> Oh J-A-N-E-T I love you so

Janet: <How was your orgasm?> Oh, it's nicer than Betty Munroe had
    Now we're engaged and I'm so glad
    That you {met Mom}<fuck Mom> and you {know Dad}<blow Dad>
    I've one thing to say and that's Brad, I'm mad, for you too
    Oh Brad...

Brad: {Oh... dammit!}<Oh... shit!>

Janet: {I'm mad...}<I'm... pregnant>

Brad: {Oh... Janet!}<Ohhhhhh... shit!>

Janet: {For you...}<It's not yours>

Brad & Janet: {I love you too-ooo-ooo}<I wonder who-ooo-ooose>
    There's one thing left to do - ah-oo

Brad: And that's go see the man who began it
    When we met in his science exam-it <What the fuck's an exam-it?>
    Made me give you the eye and then panic
    Now I've one thing to say and that's
    Dammit, Janet, I love you <Asshole twostep!>
    Dammit, Janet

Janet: Oh Brad, I'm mad

Brad: Dammit, Janet

Brad & Janet: {I love you}<I sniff glue>

<Split the screen four ways and show me a man with no neck!>

# Crim Pt. 1

Crim: <I bet you'd like something!> I would like, ah, if I may, <You may not!> to take you <Take me! Take me!> on a strange journey.

<How strange was it?/So strange they made a movie about it!>

<Not the book, the movie! Open the movie!>

[Crim opens the book] <Hey, do you want to see my Pokemon cards? (start naming Pokemon)>

[Picture of Brad] <Asshole!>

[Picture of Janet] <Slut!>

[Crim onscreen behind book] <Agh! The book ate his neck!>

Crim: It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors <Asshole!> and his fiancee Janet Weiss <Slut!>, two young, ordinary, healthy kids, left Denton that late November evening, to visit a Dr. Everett Scott, ex-tutor, and now friend to both of them.
    <Is it true you fuck girl scouts?> It's true that there were dark storm clouds <describe your balls!>, heavy, <woo!> black, <woo!> and pendulous, <woo!> towards which they were driivng.
    <Is it true also you fuck boy scouts?> It's true, also, that the spare tire they were carrying was badly in need of some air <like your fucking neck!> but, uh, they being normal kids and, on a night out...
    [Camera zooms on Crim's chim]

[[Cast: Fuck the Crim's chin with your hands!]]

Crim: <Chant: Fuck that chin! Fuck that chin!>
    Well, they were not goig to let a storm spoil the events of their evening, were they?
    It was a night out that they were going to remember... <For how long?> For a very long time. 

[Melting transition] <You're so ugly you make the screen melt!>    

# Driving to Dr. Scott's

[Car approaching] <(Batman theme) Nananana nananana nananana nananana asshole!>

[In time with windshield wipers] <Asshole... slut... asshole... slut...>

Nixon: I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interests of America first. America needs a full time president and a full time Congress, particularly at this time with these problems.

[A motorcycle drives towards the screen] <How many motorcycles is that, Janet?>

Janet: Gosh, that's the third motorcycle that's passed us. <No, it's the first, dumb slut!>
    They sure do take their lives in their hands, what with the weather and all.

Brad: Yes, Janet, life's pretty cheap to that type.

Janet: Oh. [Still chewing...] <She chews and chews and but, never swallows!> What's the matter, Brad darling? <I came on the windshield!>

Brad: Hmmm.. we must have taken the wrong fork a few miles back. <Or the right spoon!>

Janet: Oh, but where did that motorcyclist come from?

Brad: Hmmm... well I guess we'll just have to turn back.

Janet: Oh! What was that bang?

Brad: We must have a blowout. DAMMIT! I knew I should have gotten that spare tire fixed. <Asshole!> Well, you just stay here keep warm and I'll go for help.

Janet: But where will you go in the middle of nowhere?

Brad: Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles? Maybe they have a telephone I could use. <Castles don't have phones, asshole!>

Janet: I'm going with you.

Brad: Oh, no, darling, there's no sense in both of us getting wet. <She already is!>

Janet: I'm coming with you! Besides darling, the owner of that phone might be a beautiful woman <He sure is!>, and you might never come back again.

Brad: Heh, heh, heh, heh.

<Asshole tire repair: kick twice to inflate!> [Brad kicks the tire]<I said TWICE! Asshole!>

# Over At The Frankenstein Place

((Squirt water if your theatre allows it, and hold your newspapers over your head!))

<(You may need to practice the next callback a bit to get the timing right. Shoot for spending about 17 seconds reading the entire thing from start to end, with a pause at the "..." for about a second for effect. You'll need to read the letters each at ~190bpm.)>

<How long does it take to read a sign? Let's find out! E-N-T-E-R space A-T space Y-O-U-R space O-W-N space R-I-S-K exclamation point exclamation point. ... WHY IS IT STILL ONSCREEN?!?>

<Watch out for the slut-eating tree!> [Janet hits branch]

Janet: In the velvet darkness of the blackest night
    Burning bright, there's a guiding star
    No matter what or who you are

Brad & Janet: There's a light

Chorus: Over at the Frankenstein place

Brad & Janet: There's a light

Chorus: <Where's the better script?> Burning in the fireplace

<Meaningless zoom!>

Brad & Janet: There's a light, light
    In the darkness of everybody's life

Riff-Raff: The darkness must go down the river of night's dreaming
    Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming
    <Look out for the indoor lightning machine!>
    Into my life
    Into my life

Brad & Janet: There's a light

Chorus: Over at the Frankenstein place

Brad & Janet: There's a light

[[Screen pans up to a cross: Run up and shout defiance at the cross - "God is dead! God is dead!"; when the lightning hits, yelp and fall.]]

Chorus: <Where are the Epstein files?> Burning in the fireplace
    There's a light, a light

Brad & Janet: In the darkness of everybody's life

# Crim Pt. 2

[Crim flips to map] <This guy's so gay he can't even draw a straight line!>

Crim: And so, it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet <Unlike your neck!> and that they had found the assistance that their plight required. <They had?> ...Or had they?

# Into the Foyer

Janet: Brad, let's go back, I'm cold and I'm frightened...

Brad: Just a moment Janet, they might have a phone. <Castles don't have phones, asshole!>

[Door creaks open] <Dooooooorgasm!>

Riff: Hello.

Brad: <Are you drunk or high?> Hi! My name is Brad Majors <Asshole!>, and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss <Slut!>. I wonder if you could help us. You see, our car broke down a few miles up the road... do you have a phone we might use? <Castles don't have phones, asshole!>

Riff: You're wet. <She's always wet!>

Janet: Yes. It's raining. <No shit, sherlock!>

Brad: <Hey Brad, are you gay?> Yes.

Riff: <Hey Riff, are you gay?> Yes.
    <Hey God, are you gay?> [Lightning flash] <Oh shit!>
    I think perhaps you better both <fuck off!> come inside.

Janet: You're too kind.

<Can you spot the lesbian in this picture?/No, there's a slut in the way!>

Janet: Oh Brad, I'm frightened. What kind of a place is this?

Brad: <Describe Maralago!> Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

Janet: Oh.

Riff: <How do you finger your sister, Riff?> This way.

Janet: Are you having a party? <It's my sisters Bar Mitzvah, tonight she becomes a man!>

Riff: You've arrived on a rather special night. <TUESDAY!> It's one of the master's affairs. <Which one?>

Janet: Oh, lucky him.

Magenta: You're lucky, he's lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky! Ha ha ha... <The banister's lucky!>

# The Time Warp

((Get the fuck out of your seats and do what the song says!))

[Clock tolls]

Riff: It's astounding
    Time is fleeting
    Madness takes its toll
    But listen closely

Magenta: Not for very much longer

Riff: I've got to keep control.
    I remember doing the time-warp
    Drinking those moments when
    The blackness would hit me

Riff & Magenta: And the void would be calling

Transylvanians: Let's do the time-warp again
    Let's do the time-warp again

Crim: It's just a jump to the left

All: And then a step to the right

Crim: With your hands on your hips

All: You bring your knees in tight
    But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you in-sane
    <Group sex! Group sex! Group sex! Group sex! Group sex!>
    Let's do the time-warp again
    Let's do the time-warp again

Magenta: It's so dreamy, oh fantasy free me
    So you can't see me
    <Do you douche?> No, not at all
    In another dimension,
    With voyeuristic intention
    Well secluded
    I see all

Riff: With a bit of a mind {flip}<fuck>

Magenta: You're into the time slip
    [Mag rubs bird] <Fuck that bird!>
    [Mag rubs pole] <Fuck that pole!>

Riff: And nothing can ever be the same

Magenta: You're spaced out on sensation

Riff: <What's sister-fucking like?> Like you're under sedation

All: Let's do the time-warp again
    Let's do the time-warp again

Columbia: Well I was walking down the street just a-having a think
    When this snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
    He shook me up, he took me by surprise
    He had a pickup truck, and the devil's eyes
    He stared at me and I felt a change
    Time meant nothing, never would again

All: Let's do the time-warp again
    Let's do the time-warp again

Crim: It's just a jump to the left

All: [Center screen, man with party hat and round glasses appears again]
    And then a step to the right

Crim: With your hands on your hips

All: You bring your knees in tight
    But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you in-sane
    <Group sex! Group sex! Group sex! Group sex!>
    Let's do the time-warp again
    Let's do the time-warp again

[Columbia does her whole tap routine thingy]

All: Let's do the time-warp again
    Let's do the time-warp again

Crim: It's just a jump to the left! <Get the fuck off the desk!>

All: And then a step to the right

Crim: With your hands on your hips

All: You bring your knees in tight
    But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you in-sane
    <Group sex! Group sex! Group sex! Group sex! Group sex!>
    Let's do the time-warp again
    Let's do the time-warp again

# Frank's Descent

Janet: Brad, say something. <Say something stupid, asshole!>

Brad: Say, do any of you guys know how to Madison?

Janet: Brad, please, let's get out of here.

Brad: For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.

[Building bass line]

Janet: But it... it seems so unhealthy here.

Brad: It's just a party, Janet.

Janet: Well - I want to go.

Brad: Well we can't go anywhere until I get to a phone. <Castles don't have phones, asshole!>

Janet: Well then ask the butler or someone.

Brad: Just a moment, Janet - we don't want to interfere with their celebration.

Janet: This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce, Brad.

Brad: They're probably foreigners with ways different than our own. They may do some more... folk dancing.

Janet: Look, I'm cold, I'm wet, and I'm just plain scared!

Brad: I'm here - there's nothing to worry about.

# Sweet Transvestite

Frank: How d'you do, I
    See you've met my
    Faithful handyman
    He's just a little brought down
    Because when you knocked
    He thought you were the candyman
    Don't get strung out
    by the way I look
    Don't judge a book by its cover
    I'm not much of a man
    by the light of day
    But by night I'm one hell of a lover.
    I'm just a sweet transvestite
    From Transsexual, Transylvania
    Let me show you around
    Maybe play you a sound
    You look like you're both pretty groovy
    Or if you want something visual
    That's not too abysmal
    We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie

Brad: I'm glad we caught you at home
    Could we use your phone? <Castles don't have phones, asshole!>
    We're both in a bit of a hurry.

Janet: Right.

Brad: We'll just say where we are
    Then go {back to the car}<fuck in the car>
    We don't want to be any worry.
    [Frank throws water]

Frank: Well you got caught with a flat, well, how 'bout that?
    Well, babies, don't you panic
    [Frank spins hands] By the light of the night
    it'll all seem alright
    I'll get you a satanic mechanic
    I'm just a sweet transvestite
    [Watch Frank's hips]
    From Transsexual, Transylvania
    Why don't you stay for the night?

Riff: Night.

Frank: Or maybe a bite?

Columbia: Bite.

Frank: I could show you my favorite obsession.
    I've been making a man
    With blond hair and a tan
    And he's good for relieving my
    <sexual!> ...tension
    I'm just a sweet transvestite
    From Transsexual, Transylvania
    HIT IT, HIT IT!
    I'm just a sweet transvestite

Rest: Sweet transvestite

Frank: From Transsexual,

Rest: Transylvania

Frank: So - come up to the lab,
    And see what's on the slab.
    I see you shiver with antici- <this movie would really suck without audience partici> ...pation.
    But maybe the rain
    Isn't really to blame.
    So I'll remove the cause.
    But not the symptom.

    
# The Elevator

Brad: Oh, thank you very much.

Janet: Oh! Brad!

Brad: It's all right Janet. We'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.

Columbia: Oh, slowly, slowly! It's too nice a job to rush.

Brad: Hi, my name is Brad Majors <Asshole!>, and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss <Slut!>; ah.. you are...?

Columbia: You're very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory. Some people would give their right arm for the privilege. <Or their left tit!>

Brad: People like you maybe.

Columbia: <Look out for the clown horn!> Ha! I've seen it.

Magenta: Come along - the master doesn't like to be kept waiting.
    Shift it!

<Riff, can you hold your liquor?> [Riff drops the bottle] <I guess not!>

Janet: Is he, um, Frank I mean - is he your husband?

Riff: The master is not yet married, nor do I think he ever will be. We are simply his <slaves> servants. <Same thing!>

Janet: Oh.

# The Laboratory

[After the elevator opens]

Frank: <What's your favorite color?> Magenta. <Where do you get your drugs from?> Columbia. Go assist Riff Raff. I will entertain <the cameraman, with the world's largest handjob!> ...uh huh huh...

Brad: Brad Majors <Asshole!>. This is my fiancee, Janet "Vice".

Janet: Weiss. <Slut!>

Brad: Weiss? Um.

Frank: <Say something French!> Enchante. <What's that mean?> Well! <Wrong!> How nice. <Close enough.> And what charming underclothes you both have. But here. Put these on. They'll make you feel less... <naked> vulnerable. <Same thing!>
    It's not often we receive visitors here, let alone offer them... {hospitality}<horse brutality>.

Brad: {Hospitality!?}<Horse brutality?!> <I haven't had that since I was a kid!> All we wanted to do was to use your telephone, Goddammit, a reasonable request which you've chosen to ignore! <Castles don't have phones, asshole!>

Janet: Brad, don't be ungrateful.

<It's a bird! It's a plane! It's...>

Brad: Ungrateful! 
    [Brad takes off glasses]

<Super Asshole! With his sidekick Wonder Slut!>

Frank: How forceful you are, Brad. Such a perfect specimen of manhood. So... dominant. You must be awfully proud of him, Janet.

Janet: <Are you a slut?> Well, yes I am.

Frank: Do you have any tattoos, Brad?

Brad: Certainly not!

Frank: Oh well,.. how about you?

Janet: No.

Riff: Everything is in readiness, master. We merely await your... word.
    [Frank spills on Riff] <Oh shit, my best suit! My only suit...>

Frank: Tonight, my unconventional conventionists, you are about to witness a new breakthrough in {biochemical}<bisexual> research... and paradise is to be mine!

[Close up of speaker] <That's a well-hung speaker...> 

Frank: It was strange the way it happened... 

[Cut to Frank] <THAT'S a well hung speaker!>

Frank: suddenly you get a break... Whole pieces seem to fit into place, not a sign of being.. What a fool! The answer was there all the time, It took a small accident to make it happen... an accident...

Mag & Col: An accident!

Frank: ..and that's how I discovered the secret, that elusive ingredient, <Who gave the best head on Star Trek?> that SPARK that is the breath of life... Yes, I have that knowledge... I hold the secret... To life... Itself!
    (( Twirl those noisemakers! ))
    [Janet applauds]
    [Brad stops Janet]

# The Resurrection

Frank: You see, you are fortunate.
    For tonight is the night that my beautiful creature is destined to be BORN!

(( Noise makers! ))

Frank: Hoopla!
    Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator!
    And step the reactor power input...
    {three more points}<Three! More! Doritos!>

[Riff turning wheel] <I... think... I... can... I... think... I... can...>

Janet: Oh, Brad!

Brad: <Describe the Supreme Court!> It's all right, Janet!

Frank: <What do you say when you get sand in your lube?> Oh! Rocky!

# The Sword of Damocles

Rocky: The sword of Damocles is hanging over my head,
    And I've got the feeling someone's gonna be cutting the thread

Frank: You IDIOT!!

Rocky: Oh, woe is me my life is a misery
    Oh, can't you see, that I'm at the start of a {pretty big downer}<pretty bad movie>
    I woke up this morning with a start when I fell out of bed

All: That ain't no crime <Except in Texas!>

Rocky: And left from my dreaming was a feeling of unnameable dread

All: That ain't no crime

Rocky: My high is low, I'm dressed up with no place to go
    And all I know is I'm at the start of a {pretty big downer}<pretty bad movie>

Frank: Oh, Rocky!

All: Sha-la-la-la that ain't no crime

Rocky: Oh ho no no

All: Sha-la-la-la that ain't no crime

Rocky: Oh ho no no

All: Sha-la-la-la that ain't no crime, that ain't no crime

Rocky: The sword of Damocles is hanging over my head

Frank: Well, really!

All: That ain't no crime

Rocky: And I've got the feeling someone's going to be cutting the thread

All: Sha-la-la-la that ain't no crime

Rocky: Oh, woe is me, my life is a mystery
    And, can't you see, that I'm at the start of a {pretty big downer}<pretty bad movie>

# Admiring Rocky

Frank: Well really. That's no way to behave on your first day out. (Of the closet!) 
    But since you're such an exceptional beauty, I am prepared to forgive you. 
    <If you're horny and you know it, bang your bars!>
    <If you're horny and you know it, bang your bars!>
    <If you're horny and you know it>
    <Then your dick will surely show it>
    <If you're horny and you know it bang your bars!>

[Rocky bangs bars]

Frank: Oh, I just love {success}<gay sex>.

Riff: He's a credit to your genius, master.

Frank: Yes.

Magenta: A triumph of your will.

Frank: Yes.

Columbia: He's O.K.

[Frank rolls eyes toward Columbia] <Where's the tits off my tank button?>

Frank: Okay? OKAY?!? [Frank smacks tank] <Oh, there it is!> I think we can do better than that. Humph! Well, Brad and Janet <tap tap tap>, what do you think of him?

Janet: <Lie, slut!> Well, I don't like men with too many muscles.

Frank: I didn't make him FOR YOU! He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval.

# I Can Make You A Man

Frank: <Describe Elon Musk!> A weakling <Describe his wallet!>, weighing ninety-eight pounds
    Will get sand in his face
    When kicked to the ground;
    And soon in the gym with a determined chin
    The sweat from his pores as he works for his cause
    Will make him glisten <What's your favorite toothpaste?>... and gleam. <Fuck you, mine's Colgate!>
    And with massage
    and just a little bit of steam, <Lower! Lower! Lower! Lower!>
    <Awww, missed it!>
    He'll be pink and quite clean
    He'll be a strong man,
    Oh honey...

Frank & Trans: But the wrong man

Frank: He'll eat nutritious, <cum!> high protein <cum!> and swallow raw eggs <chicken cum!>
    Try to build up his shoulders, his chest, arms, and... legs
    Such an effort if he only knew of my plan
    In just seven days... <And seven nights and seven inches>

Frank & Trans:  I can make you a man

Frank: He'll do press-ups, and chin-ups, do the snatch, clean and jerk
    He thinks dynamic tension must be hard work
    Such strenuous living I just don't understand
    When in just seven days, <And seven nights and seven inches> oh baby
    I can make you a man

["Deep freeze" light begins to flash]

# Hot Patootie (Bless My Soul)

Columbia: Eddie!

Eddie: Woo!
    Whatever happened to Saturday night <Sunday morning!>
    When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright?
    It don't seem the same since cosmic light
    Came into my life, I thought I was divine
    I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go,
    And listen to the music on the radio
    A saxophone was blowin' in a rock 'n roll show
    You climbed in the back seat, you really had a good time
    Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll
    Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll
    Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll
    Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll

[Sax solo] <This solo sucks, can you play Careless Whisper?>

Trans: Lovely party!

Eddie: [Eddie kicks] <Eat! Shit! and! Die!>
    My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled
    My hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt
    I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
    And she'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine
    Get back in front, put some hair oil on
    Buddy Holly was singing his very last song
    With your arms around your girl you'd try to sing along
    It felt pretty good, Woo! You really had a good time

All: Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll
    Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll
    Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll
    Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll

# It Was A Mercy Killing!

<Would you PLEASE hit the mute button, Frank?> [Frank drops the pickax on the ground and Columbia stops screaming]

<Oh my God, you killed Eddie!/You bastard!>

<Magenta knows what to do with used rubbers.> [Magenta starts peeling off Frank's gloves.] <Turn them inside-out and use them again!>

[Rocky bangs on the elevator door] <My dick's in the door! My dick's in the door!>

Frank: Don't be upset...It was a mercy killing... He had a certain naive charm, but no muscle... Oh!

# I Can Make You A Man (Reprise)

Frank: But a deltoid and a bicep
    A hot groin and a tricep
    Makes me oooh, shake
    Makes me want to take Charles Atlas by the... {ha-ha-hand}<ba-a-alls>.

Frank & Trans: In just seven days... <And seven nights and seven inches>
    I can make you a man

Frank: [In time with walk] <Strut! Strut! Strut!> I don't want no dissention, just dynamic tension.

Janet: I'm a muscle fan. <Shut up, slut!>

Frank: In just seven days, <And seven nights and seven inches>
    I can make you a man
    Dig it if you can (["Sexy and I Know It"] Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle, yeah!)
    In just seven days, (And seven nights and seven inches)
    I can make you a man

Transylvanians: Frank and Rocky, rah-rah-rah! Frank and Rocky, rah-rah-rah! Frank and Rocky, rah-rah-rah! Frank and Rocky, rah-rah-rah!

<ASSUME THE POSITION!> [Frank jumps up onto Rocky]

# Crim Pt. 3

Crim: There are those who say that life is an illusion, <like your fucking neck!> and that reality is but a figment of the imagination. <Like your fucking neck!>
    If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe. <Unlike your neck!>
    However, the sudden departure of their host... <and his neck>
    and his creation... <and his neck>
    ... into the seclusion of his sombre bridal {suite}<(falsetto) SUITE!!!>...
    ...had left them feeling both apprehensive <and neckless> and uneasy <and unnecked>.
    A feeling which grew <unlike your neck> as the other guests departed <with their necks>,
    and they were shown to their separate rooms. <With their seperate necks.>

# Settling in for the Night

[Cut to Riff and Magenta] <10 subscription services and the only thing on is the Slut Network! And it's a rerun!>

[Cut to Brad] <Same room, different color!>

[Cut to Riff and Magenta] <Hey Janet - there's a dildo on the bed.>

# Same Room, Different Color (Janet)

Janet: Who is it? Who's there?

Frank (Brad): It's only me, Janet.

Janet: Oh, Brad darling, come in. <And out and in and out and in> Oh! Brad Oh... Yes, my darling...but what if...

Frank (Brad): It's all right, Janet, everything's going to be alright.

Janet: Oh, I hope so, my darling. Oh...Ah...ahh OHHH! Oh it's you!

Frank: I'm afraid so, Janet, but isn't it nice...

Janet: Oh, you beast, you monster...Oh what have you done with Brad?

Frank: Oh, well, nothing. <Yet!> Why, do you think I should?

Janet: You tricked me...I wouldn't have...I've never...never...

Frank: Yes, yes I know, but it isn't all bad, is it? I think you really found it quite pleasurable.

Janet: Oh, stop...I mean help... Brad Brad!..Oh Brad!! <Not Brad, different hair!>

Frank: Shhh. Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like...This!

Janet: Like this..like how??! Oh, it's your fault...you're to blame... I was saving myself... <For what, a rainy day? Look outside bitch, it's pouring!>

Frank: Well, I'm sure you're not SPENT yet...

Janet: Promise you won't tell Brad?

Frank: Cross my heart and hope to die...

# Poking the Monster

<It's the hard-knock life for us, it's the hard-knock life for us...>

[Elbow sex begins] <Elbow sex! Elbow sex! Elbow sex!>

# Same Room, Different Color (Brad)

Frank (Janet): Oh, Brad darling, it's no good here. It'll destroy us.

Brad: Don't worry Janet, we'll be away from here in the morning.

Frank (Janet): Oh, Brad you're so strong and protective.

Brad: YOU!

Frank: I'm afraid so, Brad, but isn't it nice...

Brad: Why YOU! What have you done with Janet? <Fucked the shit out of her!>

Frank: Nothing. Why? Do you think I should?

Brad: You tricked me, I wouldn't have...I've never never...never...

Frank: Oh Yes yes, I know...but it isn't all bad, is it? Not even half bad, I think you really quite enjoyed it. Oh... so soft...

Brad: Stop it...stop it...oh Janet...JANET! <Not Janet, different hair!>

Frank: Shhh! Janet's probably asleep by now, do you want her to see you... like this! 

Brad: Like this, like how? It's your fault, you're to blame, I thought it was the real thing!

Frank: Oh come on, Brad, admit it, you liked it, didn't you? There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure, Brad. <There is in Texas!> Oh Brad, you've wasted so much time already... Janet needn't know, I won't tell.

Brad: Well, promise you won't tell...

Frank: On my mother's graoouuuuuu.... <Don't talk with your mouth full!>

Riff: Master, Rocky has broken his chains and vanished. The new playmate is loose and somewhere on the grounds. Magenta has just released... the dogs.

Frank: Mmmmm? Coming! <So's Brad!>

# Janet Finds the Monster

Janet: What's happening here? Where's Brad? <Having sex!> Where's anybody? <Having sex!>
    Oh, Brad. Brad, my darling, how could I have done this to you?
    Oh, if only we hadn't made this journey... <But you did!>
    If only the car hadn't broken down... <But it did!>
    Oh, if only we were amongst friends... <But you're not!>
    Or sane persons. <But you aren't!>
    Oh Brad, what have they done with him...
    Oh Brad - How could you?

[Cut to Rocky] <Leave him alone, he's monster-bating!>

Janet: Oh, but you're hurt.. Did they do this to you? Here, I'll dress your wounds... Poor baby, there...

Mag & Col: Tell us about it, Janet.

# Toucha Toucha Toucha Touch Me

Janet: I was feeling done in,
    Couldn't win
    I'd only ever kissed before

Columbia: You mean she's...

Magenta: Uh huh. <Catholic!>

Janet: I thought there's no use getting
    Into heavy petting
    It only leads to trouble and seat wetting
    Now all I want to know is how to go <Try down!>
    I've tasted {blood}<cum> and I want more

Mag & Col: More <less!>, more <less!>, more <less!>

Janet: I'll put up no resistance
    I want to stay the distance
    I've got an itch to scratch
    I need assistance
    Toucha toucha toucha touch me
    I want to be dirty
    Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
    Creature of the night
    Then if anything grows
    While you pose
    I'll oil you up and rub you down

Mag & Col: Down <up!>, down <up!>, down <up!>

Janet: And that's just one small fraction
    Of the main attraction
    You need a friendly hand <job!> and I need action
    [Rocky mushes tits]
    Toucha toucha toucha touch me
    I want to be dirty
    Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
    Creature of the night

Columbia: Toucha toucha toucha touch me

Magenta: I want to be dirty.

Columbia: Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me

Magenta: Creature of the night.

Janet: [Rainbow]
    Oh, Toucha toucha toucha touch me
    I want to be dirty
    Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
    Creature of the night <Cast orgy!>

Rocky: Creature of the night <Uglier!>

Brad: Creature of the night? <No glasses!>

Frank: Creature of the night. <Bad hair!>

Magenta: Creature of the night. <Less hair!>

Riff: Creature of the night. <Not THAT less!>

Columbia: [Cut to Columbia] <AHH!> Creature of the night <Start over!>

Rocky: Creature of the night! <Sloppy sevenths!>

Janet: Creature of the night! <It took seven people to make her come!>

# Dr. Scott Arrives

Riff: <How do you say 'thank you' in French?> Merrrrrcy!

Frank: How did it happen? I understood you were to be watching!

Riff: I was only away for a minute... master <-bating!>.

Frank: Well, see if you can find him on the monitor.

Riff: Master. Master...we have a visitor.

[Scott on monitor]

Brad: Hey, Scotty! ...Dr. Everett Scott.

Riff: You know this earthling ...person?

Brad: I most certainly do! He happens to be an old friend of mine.

Frank: I see. So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.
    You came here {with a purpose}<On a porpoise!>.

Brad: I told you, {my car broke down}<my dolphin broke down!>.
    I was telling the truth. <I used Truth Social!>

Frank: I know what you told me... but this Dr. Everett Scott, his name is not unknown to me. <I'm subscribed to his Youtube!>

Brad: He was a science teacher at Denton High School.

Frank: And now he works for your government, doesn't he, Brad? He's attached to the bureau of investigation of that which you call UFOs! Isn't that right, Brad?

Brad: He might be...I don't know.

Riff: The intruder is entering the building, master.

Frank: He'll probably be... in the Zen room.
    Shall we inquire of him in person?

<Oh boy, it's the cultural appropriation room!>

[Scotty starts moving] <I don't like the new Fast and Furious!>

[Circling the women] <Ring aroud the lesbians!>

[Scotty up the stairs] <Hey, Kool-Aid!>

[Crash through wall] <(Kool-Aid man) Oh yeah!>

Brad: Great Scott!
(( Throw Toilet Paper! ))

Dr. Scott: Frank N Furter - we meet at last.

Brad: Dr. Scott!

Scott: Brad! What are you doing here?

Frank: Don't play games, Dr. Scott. You know perfectly well what Brad Majors is doing here. It was part of your plan, was it not? That he and his female should check the layout for you. Well, unfortunately for you, all the plans are to be changed. I am adaptable, Dr. Scott; I know Brad is.

Scott: I can assure you that Brad's presence here comes as a complete surprise to me. I came here to find Eddie.

Brad: {Eddie}<Dinner!>? I've seen him!

Frank: Eddie! What do you know of Eddie, Dr. Scott?

Scott: I happen to know a great deal about a lot of things.
    You see Eddie happens to be {my nephew}<my dinner!>.

[Janet gasps] <Janet finally came!>

Brad: Dr. Scott.

[Frank pulls off sheet]

Janet: Ah!

Scott: Janet!

Janet: Dr. Scott!

Brad: Janet!

Janet: Brad!

Frank: Rocky! <Bullwinkle!>

Scott: Janet!

Janet: Dr. Scott!

Brad: Janet!

Janet: Brad!

Frank: Rocky! <Bullwinkle!>

Scott: Janet!

Janet: Dr. Scott!

Brad: Janet!

Janet: Brad!

Frank: Rocky! <Bullwinkle!>

Frank: Listen... I made you... and I can break you just as easily. <Kinky!>

Magenta: Master, {dinner}<Eddie!> is prepared!

Frank: Excellent. Under the circumstances, formal dress is to be optional. <Chant: Toga! Toga! Toga!/Chant: Naked! Naked! Naked!>

# Crim Pt. 4

<This man has no fucking neck!>

Crim: Food has always played a vital role in Life's rituals. The breaking of the bread, the last meal of the condemned man, and now, this meal. However informal it might appear, you can be sure that there was to be very little... bonhomie.

# Dinner

[Riff drops meat] <Eddie, get your fat ass off the table!>

[Magneta lifts knife] <It's the Black and Decker Pecker Whacker! It slices! It dices! It fucks Janet Weisses! It sodomizes, circumsizes, lobotomizes,> [Frank starts knife] <and oh BOY does it cut meat.>

[As Frank carves] <(Sesame Street Count) One! One skin! Ah-ha-ha! Two! Two skins! Ah-ha-ha! Three! Three skins! Ah-ha-ha! Four! Four skins! Ah-ha-ha!>

<What kind of wine is it, Riff?> [Riff spills wine] <Table wine!> <Riff STILL can't hold his liquor!>

Frank: A toast! - to absent friends...

((Throw toast if your theatre allows it!))

All: To absent friends.

Frank: And, Rocky.
    [Frank finishes putting on hat]

((Put on your party hats!))
Frank: Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy Birthday dear Rocky... Shall we?

Scott: We came here to discuss Eddie.

Columbia: Eddie?!

Frank: That's a rather tender subject. <That's a rather tasteless joke!> Another slice anyone?

Columbia: Excuse me...

Scott: I knew he was in with a bad crowd, but it was worse than I imagined... Aliens!

Rocky: Ugh?!

Brad & Janet: Doctor Scott!

Frank: Go on, Dr. Scott. Or should I say Dr. Von Scott?

Brad: Just what exactly are you implying?

Scott: It's all right!

Brad: But Dr. Scott!

Scott: That's all right, Brad!

# Eddie's Teddy

Scotty: From the day he was born, <Not the night, but the day>
    He was trouble <Not Monopoly, but Trouble>
    He was the thorn, <Not the rose, but the thorn>
    In his mutters side <Not the ass, but the side>
    {She tried in vain}<She tried cocaine> <in the artery and the vein>

Crim: But he never caused her nothing but shame <Shame, shame, shame (do the finger rubbing thing alongside this)>

Scotty: He left home the day she died <Can we pick this shit up?>
    From the day she was gone
    All he wanted
    Was rock 'n roll, porn, <You call THAT porn?!?>
    Und ein motor bike
    Shooting up junk

Crim: He was a low down cheap little punk

Scotty: Taking everyone for a ride

All: When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
    You knew he was a no good kid
    But when he threatened your life with switch blade knife

Frank: What a guy

Janet: Makes you cry

Scotty: Und I did

Columbia: {Everybody shoved him}<Everbody sucked him>
    {I very nearly loved him}<I very nearly fucked him>
    I said "Hey, listen to me!
    Stay sane inside insanity"
    But he locked the door and threw away the key

Scotty: But he must have been drawn <Not sketched, but drawn>
    Into something
    Making him warn <Not you, but...>
    Me in a note which reads

All: What's it say, what's it say?

Eddie: "I'm out of my hed
    Oh hurry or I may be dead
    They mustn't carry out their evil deeds" [screams] <Too late!>

All: When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
    You knew he was a no good kid
    But when he threatened your life with switch blade knife

Frank: What a guy

Janet: Makes you cry

Scotty: Und I did

All: When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
    You knew he was a no good kid
    But then he threatened your life with switch blade knife

Frank: What a guy

All: Whoah oh oh

Janet: Makes you cry

All: Hey hey hey

Scotty: Und I did

All: Eddie

# Planet, Schmanet, Janet

Frank: Oh, Rocky! (What? She gots boobies!) How could you?

Riff: Shut up!

Frank: I'll tell you once; I won't tell you twice
    You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss
    Your apple pie don't taste too nice
    You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss <Slut!>
    I've laid the seed; it should be all you need
    You're as sensual as a pencil, wound up like an E or first string
    When we made it, didja hear a bell ring? <Ding-dong! (If you have an actual bell, ring it!)> 
    Ya gotta block? Well, take my advice
    You better wise up, Janet Weiss <Slut!>
    The transducer will seduce ya!

Janet: My feet! I can't move my feet!

Scott: My wheels! My God, I can't move my wheels!

Brad: It's as if we're glued to the spot!

Frank: <Can you spell 'europe'?> You are! So quake with fear, you tiny fools!

Janet: <Go for the Oscar, slut!> We're trapped!

Frank: It's something you'll get used to. A mental mind fuck can be nice!

Scott: [Entrances of the help] You won't find Earth people quite the easy mark you imagine. This sonic transducer...it is, I suppose, some kind of audio-vibrato- physio-molecular transport device?

Brad: You mean...

Scott: Yes, Brad, it's something we ourselves have been working on for quite some time. But it seems our friend here has found a means of perfecting it. A device which is capable of breaking down solid matter and then projecting it through space and, who knows, perhaps even time.. itself!

Janet: You mean he's going to send us to another planet?

Frank: Planet, shmanet, Janet! <Hip check!>
    You better wise up, Janet Weiss <Slut!>
    <What do you do when you run out of toilet paper, Frank?> [Frank rubs against Janet]
    You better wise up, build your thighs up You better wise up

Crim: And then she cried out...

Janet: Stop!

Frank: on't get hot and flustered!
    <What do you do when you're out of lube?> Use a bit of mustard

Brad: You're a hot dog but you better not try to
    hurt her, Frank Furter

Scott: You're a hot dog but you better not try to
    hurt her, Frank Furter

Janet: You're a hot dog- <Shut up slut, it wouldn't have rhymed anyway!>

# Columbia's Rant

Columbia: My God! I can't stand any more of this! First you spurn me for Eddie, and then you throw him off like an old overcoat for Rocky! You chew people up and then you spit them out again! <Doesn't ANYONE in this movie swallow?> I loved you. Do you hear me? I loved you! And what did it get me? Yeah, I'll tell you: a big nothing. You're like a sponge.
    You take, take, take, and drain others of their love and emotion.
    Yeah, well, I've had enough.
    You're gonna choose between me and Rocky, so named because of the rocks in his head.

[Columbia is Medusa-fied] <BLT! Bigger left tit!>

<What a great party, everyone's getting stoned!>

# Dealing With The Help

Frank: It's not easy having a good time... Even smiling makes my face ache...
    [Walks to the freezer door] And my children turn on me... Rocky's behaving just the way that Eddie did. Do you think I made a mistake, splitting his brain between the two of them?
    [Pulls hair back]

Magenta: Ahhhh! I grow veary of this {world}<accent>!
    Ven shall vee return to Transylvania, huh?

Frank: <Where's her hand and why's he smiling?> Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both you and your brother Riff Raff. You have both served me well. Loyalty such as yours shall not go unrewarded. You will discover that when the mood takes me, I can be quite generous.

Magenta: I ask for nothing... <Under 12 inches!> Nothing.

Frank: And you shall receive it... <Where?> In {abundance}<the buttocks>!
    <Fee, fi, fo, fum, first I jerk off then I> Come, we are ready for the floor show!

<Elbow sex! Elbow sex!> [Siblings roll elbows] <The handicapped are always getting fucked over!>

# Crim Pt. 5

Crim: And so, by some extraordinary coincidence, fate, it seemed, had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with their friend, Dr. Everett Scott. But it was to be in a situation which none of them would have possibly foreseen. And, just a few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both tasted <Frank's cock!> forbidden fruit. <Same thing!>
    [Crim starts squeezing his hands] <Has anyone seen my pet gerbil Gary? He was running around on the desk... I love him so much and I'd hate to think anything.../(squeaking gerbil-y noises, raising gradually in distress as Crim squeezes)>
    [Final squeeze] <Oh my God, you killed Gary!/You bastard!>
    This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals... and some persuasion. What further indignities were they to be subjected to? <Shock Treatement!> And what of the floor show that is spoken of?
    <Where do you masturbate?> In an empty house? <When do you masturbate?> In the middle of the night?
    What diabolical plan had been shaped by Frank's crazed imagination? What indeed?
    From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic.

# Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)

Columbia: <Describe this movie!> It was great when it all began. <But now it sucks!>
    I was a regular Frankie fan
    But it was over when he had the plan
    To start a-working on a muscle man.
    Now the only thing that gives me hope
    Is my love of a certain dope
    Rose tints my world, keeps me safe from my trouble and pain

Rocky: I'm just seven hours old, <And can't dance!>
    And truly beautiful to behold <And modest, too...>
    But somebody should be told
    My libido hasn't been controlled
    Now the only thing I've come to trust <is Janet's bust!>
    Is an orgasmic rush of lust. <Same thing>
    Rose tints my world and keeps me safe from my trouble and pain

Brad: It's beyond me
    <What does Mark Zuckerburg say after snorting cocaine off a hooker's ass?> Help me Mommy!
    I'll be good; you'll see
    Take this dream away
    What's this? <The floor!> Let's see <Still the floor!>
    I feel sexy!
    What's come over me? <Frank!> Wo! Here it comes again

Janet: I feel released
    Bad times deceased
    My confidence has increased
    Reality is here
    The game has been disbanded
    My mind has been expanded
    It's a gas that Frankie's landed
    His lust is so sincere

# Rose Tint My World (Don't Dream It)

[Radio Picture] <I hear morse code for "get me out of this movie"!>

Frank: <Whatever you do, DON'T talk about Fay Wray!> Whatever happened to Fay Wray? <Dammit!>
    That delicate, satin-draped frame?
    As it clung to her thigh
    How I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same.
    <Kick the dildo!> [Kicks lever]
    Give yourself over to absolute pleasure
    Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
    Erotic nightmares, beyond any measure
    And sensual daydreams to treasure forever
    <Has anyone seen my pet Fluffy? She's about seven feet long, has eight feet, looks like a weasel fucked a pool noodle... Oh my God, Fluffy!/You bastard!>
    Can't you just see it? Oh, oh, oh... oh!
    [Frank jumps in pool] <Waiter, waiter! There's a fag in my soup!/Well, eat it anyway!> <I can't, I'm a vegetarian!/It's fine, they count as fruits!>
    Don't dream it, be it
    Don't dream it, be it
    Don't dream it, be it

All: Don't dream it, be it
    Don't dream it, be it
    Don't dream it, be it
    Don't dream it, be it
    Don't dream it, be it
    [Brad licks necklace] <The OTHER balls, Brad! The other balls!>

Scott: [Lever drops] Ach! We've got to get out of this trap before this decadence saps our wills. I've got to be strong, and try to hang on, or else my mind may well snap, and my life will be lived...
    For the thrills!

Brad: It's beyond me
    Help me Mommy! <I'm your mommy now, bitch!>

Janet: God bless Lilly St. Cyr

# Rose Tint My World (Wild And Untamed Thing)

Frank: <Whose pool is this? And tell me thirteen times!> My, my, my, my my, my my, my, my, my, my, my... my!
    I'm a wild and an untamed thing.
    I'm a bee with a deadly sting
    You get a hit and your mind goes ping
    Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing
    So let the party and the sounds rock on
    We're gonna shake it 'till the life has gone
    Rose tint my world, keep me safe from my trouble and pain
    <Meet the Beatles!> [As characters pop up] <John! Paul! George! Ringo!>

All: We're a wild and an untamed thing
    We're bees with a deadly sting
    You get a hit and your mind goes ping
    Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing
    So let the party and the sounds rock on
    We're gonna shake it 'till the life has gone
    Rose tint my world, keep me safe from my trouble and pain
    <This is where the choreographer died!>
    We're a wild and an untamed thing
    We're bees with a deadly sting
    You get a hit and your mind goes ping
    Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing
    So let the party and the sounds rock on
    We're gonna shake it 'til the life has gone, gone, gone
    Rose tint my world, keep me safe from my trouble and pain

Riff: Frank N Furter, {it's all over}<the movie's almost over...>
    {Your mission is a failure, your lifestyle's too extreme}<The film's a total failure, your hairstyle's too extreme>
    I'm your new commander, you now are my prisoner
    We return to Transylvania, prepare the transit beam

<Hey Magenta, there's a lesbian convention in the parking lot!> [Magenta moves to leave] <Ha! Works every time!>

# Frank's Explanation

Frank: Wait! <What do you say when you get caught fucking your neighbor's dog?> I can explain! <It's not my dog!>
    [Riff smiles at Magenta] <This ought to be good.>
    [Frank whispers to Columbia] <You, go fuck with an onion.>
    [Frank whispers to Rocky] <You, get an engineering degree.>
    [Columbia turns on light] <Onion.>

All: I'm going home

# The Death Of Everyone

Magenta: How sentimental.

Riff: And also presumptuous of you. You see, when I said WE were to return to Transylvania <I was speaking French!>, I referred only to Magenta and myself. I'm sorry, however, if you found my words misleading,
    {but you see, you are to remain here.}<Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya - you killed my father, prepare to die!>
    In spirit, anyway.

Scott: Great heavens! That's a laser!

Riff: Yes, Dr. Scott. A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter. <That means it's not a fucking laser, dumbass!>

Brad: You mean...you're going to kill him? What's his crime?

Scott: You saw what became of Eddie. Society must be protected. <Fuck society! / I fucked society, I got a social disease!>

Riff: Exactly, Dr. Scott. And now, Frank-N-Furter, your time has come. <Everything comes in this movie!> Say goodbye to all of this <Goodbye, all this!>, and hello... <Hello!> to oblivion!
    <Hi, oblivion, how's the wife and kids? / Wife's fine, but the kids are a little tight - sorry about the dog.>

[Columbia eye close-up] <A blink of the eye, a twitch of the lip, the first one to scream gets shot in the tit!>
[Columbia screams and is shot]
[Rocky is killed and all that jazz...]

Brad: Good God!

Janet: Oh! You killed them!

Magenta: But I thought you liked them. They liked you.

Riff: <Get paranoid, Riff!> They didn't like me! <Get REAL paranoid, Riff!> He never liked me!

Scott: You did right. <Kiss ass!>

Riff: A decision had to be made.

Scott: You're O.K. by me. <Kiss ass!>

Riff: Dr. Scott, I'm sorry about your {nephew}<dinner>.

Scott: Eddie? Yes, well, perhaps it was all for the best, heh, heh, heh.

Riff: You should leave now, Dr. Scott, while it is still possible. <Wait, it was possible before?> We are about to beam the entire house to the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go... <When?> Now!
    [Earthlings walk away] <Does this mean we can't use your phone?>
    Our noble mission is completed, my most beautiful sister, <THEY WERE SIBLINGS THE WHOLE TIME?!?!> and soon we shall return to the moon-drenched shores of our beloved planet.

Magenta: Ah, sweet Transsexual, land of night. To sing and dance once more to your dark refrain... To take that... step, to the right...

Both: <Did anyone else taste acid in the popcorn?> HAH! [Transies flash on screen] <Ack!>

Riff: But it's the pelvic THRUST...

Transylvanians: That really drives you insane!

Magenta: And our world... will do {the Time Warp... again!}<the same shit... again!>
    [Elbow roll] <Elbow quickie!>

# Superheroes

[[ As the castle takes off, help lift it! ]]

Brad: I've done a lot <of drugs!>
    God knows I've tried <lots of drugs!>
    To find the truth <about drugs!>
    I've even lied <to get drugs!>
    But all I know <about drugs!> is down inside I'm..

All: Bleeding... <Should've used lube!>

Janet: And super heroes
    Come to the feast
    To taste the flesh
    Not yet deceased
    And all I know
    Is still the beast is feeding

All: Ahh, ahh...

[[ As the overhead zooms out, go to the screen. It needs help to start spinning; help it spin until Crim stops the globe - at which point, you get flung away ]]

<Stop the world, I want to get off!>

[Crim stops globe]

<Oh my god, you killed Kenya!/You BASTARD!>

Narrator: And crawling on the planet's face... Some insects <Kill em! Kill em!>, called the human race... <oh shit, that's us!> Lost in time, and lost in space, <What does this movie lack?> And meaning.

All: <One more time for the virgins!> Meaning.

[[ When the light is turned off, point to the point of the movie! ]]

<Last one out don't forget to turn off the globe!>
